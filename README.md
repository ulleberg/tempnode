# Temperature Node Example
Simple temperature node example using Arduino UNO and the RN2483 LoRa module


[![Open in IDE8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-IDE8-blue.svg)](https://staging.ide8.io/open?repo=https://github.com/joarolai/tempnode)


## To be able to use this example with [IDE8](https://ide8.io/) you have to do the following:

- Clone this repository to your IDE8 workspace
- Run setup.sh script to download required dependencies
- Create a new application in [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)
- Add payload format shown below to TTN application
- Compile, program and run tempnode/firmware/tempnode.ino on device
- Extract Device EUI printed by the device to the serial terminal
- Register device in the TTN application using Device EUI
- Update tempnode/firmware/secrets.h with Application EUI and Application Key generated by TTN for the device.
- Compile, program and run tempnode/firmware/tempnode.ino, again
- Open tempnode/www/graph.html and see temperature sent from the device being displayed in the chart

## Known limitatons with IDE8 beta

- Manually copy tempnode/www/graph.html to www/
- Open The Things Network Tool and select TTN application and device and keep this open as long as you want data to be received and displayed in graph.html

## TTN payload format

```js
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  return {
     'temperature' : (bytes[0] << 8) + bytes[1]
  };
}
```
